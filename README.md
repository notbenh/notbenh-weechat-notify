Yet another weechat script that just hooks and then leverages
notify-send to do the dirty work. This was initially a copy of
notify-send.pl v1.4
(http://weechat.org/scripts/source/notify_send.pl.html/) that has been
heavily modified to shove a lot more in to config and then ditch the msg
caching scheme as I do not (yet) have an issue with notification spam.
